# Docker con project space

This project is going to store files that I end up creating as part of watching docker con 2022

So far:

- run `echo hello world` in a fedora container direct
- entered the container and `yum install figlet`
- pulling `jpetazzo/clock`
  - example of `-d` flag
- `docker ps` run through
- `docker run --name` run through
- `docker logs -f clock`
  - `--tail 3` = starts from last 3 lines to follow
- start of Dockerfile walk-through
  - FROM
  - RUN
  - CMD
  - ENTRYPOINT
